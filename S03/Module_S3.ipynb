    "### The Scenario as a Simulation\n",
    "We want to simulate eight cups of tea, where each cup is prepared either by pouring milk first or tea first. Then simulate allowing Muriel to GUESS for each cup whether it was prepared with milk or tea first. Therefore, her probability of guessing correctly for any one cup is 0.5. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model 1:  A Coin Toss\n",

    "These are the steps to conducting a hypothesis test:  \n",
    "1. Identify a population parameter and state null and alternative hypotheses about the parameter.<br>These should be stated in such a way that the _**null**_ hypothesis is the \"default\" assumption unless there is sufficiently strong evidence in favor of the _**alternative**_ hypothesis.\n",

    "    \n",
    "3. Use the model to determine the probability that results as extreme as those we observed would occur purely by random chance IF the null hypothesis were true. (This probability is called a p-value.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Based on the p-value, decide whether to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Draw a conclusion in the context of the scenario given.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**_To complete a hypothesis test, you must carry out steps 4 and 5 after the p-value is found._**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we will examine how we carried out each of these steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Identifying a Parameter and Hypotheses\n",
    "\n",
    "- Our parameter is the proportion of times (in the long run, or \"on average\") that Muriel will correctly identify the order that milk and tea were poured.\n",
    "- Our NULL hypothesis is our default assumption unless there is strong evidence to the contrary<br>**NULL Hypothesis:** Muriel is guessing, so in the long run, the proportion identified correctly is one half, or $p = \\frac{1}{2}$\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Our ALTERNATIVE hypothesis is the other possibility we are exploring<br>**ALTERNATIVE Hypothesis:** Muriel can actually detect a difference, so the proportion identified correctly is better than one half, or $p > \\frac{1}{2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Creating the Model of the Null Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "We explored two methods of creating a model of the null hypothesis:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use simulation/randomization to create an empirical model and find a p-value.\n",
    "2. Use a theoretical distribution to find a p-value. (There is sometimes more than one suitable theoretical distribution.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Use the Model to Find a p-Value\n",
    "\n",
    "We found a p-value for each model.  The p-value is interpreted as the following _conditional probability_:<br>\n",
    "_**If we assume that the null hypothesis is true**, the p-value is the probability that we would see results as extreme as the ones we have observed, just by random chance alone._\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Decide Whether Evidence is Sufficient to Reject Null Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on our p-values, is there strong evidence for the alternative hypothesis instead of the null hypothesis?  If so, we reject the null hypothesis.  Today's scenario may seem decisive, but we will discuss in future lessons how to decide whether our evidence is strong enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The decsion made in step 4 implies that we have drawn a conclusion about the original question we were investigating. \n",
