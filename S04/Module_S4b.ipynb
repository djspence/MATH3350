(**Note:** these parameters, $p_1$ and $p_2$, represent these true proportions across all possible patients, not just the 30 patients in the study.)  Regardless of which method above we choose to generate our p-value, our hypotheses are as follows.\n",

    "In other words, there should be at least 10 'successes' and 10 'failures' in **_each_** sample group.  The Dolphin Therapy study does not meet these conditions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Chi-Square Distribution\n",
    "The $\\chi^{2}$ family of distributions can be used to test the _independence_ of two variables. Consider our data, summarized in a _contingency table_ as follows:  \n",

    "$H_a:$ _Improvement_ and _Treatment_ are NOT INDEPENDENT\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Expected Counts \n",
    "If the null hypothesis is accurate, we would _expect_ the proportion of improved/not improved to be the same in both groups.  The $\\chi^{2}$ Test uses the OVERALL proportions in the sample data to compute \"expected counts\" that would ideally occur if the 2 variables were truly independent (e.g., we would expect the same proportion of individuals to improve, regardless of group).  \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "$\\frac{13}{30} \\approx 0.433$ is the overall proportion of participants who improved.  \n",

    "Therefore, if $H_0$ is true, we would expect $\\sim 43.3$% of the individuals in EACH group to improve; because there are 15 participants in the Dolphin group, this would be an _expected count_ of $(0.433)(15) = 6.5$.  \n",

    "| No Dolphins | 6.5 | 8.5 |\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The $\\chi^{2}$ Statistic \n",
    "\n",
    "The $\\chi^{2}$ statistic is a measure of how much the _observed_ counts differ from the _expected_ counts. It is computed across all cells in the table as:  \n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
