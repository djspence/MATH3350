    "Recall the 'ToothGrowth' data set available in R. The data set gives the length of cells responsible for tooth growth (\"odontoblasts\") in guinea pigs. We will work with a subset of the data to focus only on those guinea pigs who were given orange juice. We will assume that the average length of these cells among guinea pigs in general is 18.5 picometers (pm). Scientists treating guinea pigs with orange juice hypothesized that it would result in longer odontoblasts. Our hypothesis is about $\\mu$, the \"true\" mean odontoblast length of guinea pigs whose diet is supplemented with orange juice. (Remember, the parameter $\\mu$ represents the true mean across all guinea pigs who are given orange juice, not just those in the study.)  \n",
