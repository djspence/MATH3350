    "Statistical conclusions are based on _probability_ and _strength of evidence_.  For instance, a p-value of 0.06 will be considered significant at $\\alpha = 0.1$ but not at $\\alpha = 0.05$, leading to different conclusions depending on the strength of evidence required.  \n",

    "Outcomes that are not intended are called \"Errors\", not because the test was conducted or interpreted incorrectly, but because the inherent uncertainty of probability will sometimes lead to the wrong conclusion, even when the procedure is followed correctly.  These errors are called Type I and Type II Errors, as identified below.  \n",

Therefore, $\\alpha$ represents the probability that we could obtain such a sample and reject $H_0$ even though $H_0$ is actually true.  This means $\\alpha$ is the probability of a Type I Error.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We use $\\beta$ to represent the probability of a Type II Error.  When $H_0$ is true, the possible outcomes have probabilities $\\alpha$ and its complement, $1-\\alpha$.

    "## Power of a Statistical Test\n",
    "\n",

    "------|--------\n",
    "0.6 | Poor\n",
    "0.7 | Adequate\n",
    "0.8 | Good\n",
    "0.9 | Excellent\n",
    "\n",
    "However, recent researchers (_e.g., Correll et al., 2020_) have suggested that fixed levels for power are arbitrary and not meaningful, and that the desired power chosen should be contextual (as the choice for $\\alpha$ is contextual).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Effect Size \n",
    "The calculation of power depends on an important construct known as **_effect size_**, most commonly defined by Cohen's $d$.  In general, if we calculate the gap (or \"gain\" in some contexts) $G$ between the sample statistic and the null hypothesis, Cohen's $d$ is computed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "$d=\\frac{G}{s}$\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "    \n",
    "where s represents the standard deviation of the sample (pooled in 2-sample scenarios). \n",
    "\n",
    "Again, Cohen proposed the following thresholds for effect size. These thresholds are still treated as convention.\n",
    "\n",
    "$d$ | Effect Size \n",
    "------|--------\n",

    "0.5 | Medium\n",

    "#### Example 1. Pre-Test and Post-Test Scores\n",
    "Suppose a teacher gives students a pre-test before a lesson and a post-test after the lesson. A hypothesis test to determine the average learning gains associated with this lesson would be a **_matched pairs_** scenario with these hypotheses:\n",
